It continues to elaborate on architectural design as a process of investigation, critical observation, and experiment. It increases the emphasis on design as a synthetic process encompassing a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture: material, structure, program, site, history and representation are investigated in their relationship to the production of architectural form.Architecture Design Studio 6 continues the development of architectural designs through the further consolidation of three-dimensional and material testing of ideas. Studies in the unit will maintain a focus on developing design as a visual language and process of cultural production with an emphasis on social and environmental sustainability."
