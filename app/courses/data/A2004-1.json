It consolidates the skills and knowledge developed in ATS2901 Music theory and ear training 3 through the study and practical application of theoretical concepts in either the Western art music or jazz tradition. Further study of advanced analytical and compositional procedures in representative works incorporates the analysis and recognition of chromatic harmony, voice leading techniques and different structural levels.",
