As a capstone unit, it should be studied in the final semester of the finance major as it draws upon and integrates learning from previous units studied. The unit encourages students to recognise that finance is a powerful tool for solving our common problems, and increasing the general wellbeing, but may give rise to ethical dilemmas. Students will be exposed to choices and conflicts requiring judgement and thus appreciate that finance can play an important role in helping society achieve it's goals.",

Projects involve whole or part of the data science process (visualisation, analysis, algorithms, etc.) but can also be software-based, or they may involve investigation of theory. Projects if software-based should cover analysis through design to implementation and testing. Comprehensive written documentation on the project is required. Students are assigned in groups to a project supervisor. There are no lectures in this unit, although students will be expected to attend regular meetings with their project supervisor. The unit is the second part of a 12-credit point project sequence; the first part and entry point for the project is FIT3163.",

This unit introduces the main kinds of information graphics and interactive visualisation systems and their areas of application. It investigates the reasons why visualisation can be effective and based on this students will gain experience in critically assessing data visualisations and in designing their own visualisations. Students will learn how to create visualisations with representative computer tools and gain experience in creating a data visualisation for an application domain of their choice.",
