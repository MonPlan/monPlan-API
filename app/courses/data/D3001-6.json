From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

The unit is the first in a sequence of studies that provides students with essential skills, knowledge and understandings to critically engage with new and established curriculum frameworks, models and pedagogical approaches. A focus on socio-critical and socio-ecological approaches and practical workshop sessions are designed to challenge students' thinking about health and physical education, introduce students to a range of pedagogies, and facilitate the application of theoretical insights to pedagogical practice. National and state curriculum and assessment frameworks provide a focus for investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary developments, and the influence of competing disciplinary perspectives and political, social and cultural factors on health and physical education curriculum texts and pedagogical practices. Exploration of international developments is used to extend insights into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment models and practices.",

Within the context of 'teaching sensitive issues' and 'teaching difficult knowledge', students are supported to use sociological theories to examine power, relationships, difference and diversity. Issues explored are framed within a socio-cultural model for creating safe and supportive learning environments for young people and include sexuality, gender, sexual health, race, religion and ethnicity. Students investigate, critique and describe contemporary developments in HPE and consider how these have influenced, or are likely to influence, practices in schools. Students are introduced to key sociological ideas and are supported to develop knowledge of how to use theory to examine contemporary social issues as well as teaching practice. This deepens knowledge of and appreciation for complex issues in society and the role of HPE in creating safe and supportive learning environments for all students. Students are encouraged to reflect upon and consider how they might develop strategies as future teachers to respond to the issues examined. The unit supports students to implement relevant HPE curriculum in their future careers.",

Students investigate key priorities in primary and secondary education connected to the Australian and Victorian curricula and in relation to the professional standards of the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL). The unit explores the cross-curriculum priorities of Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, histories and cultures, and education for sustainability, as well as relevant general capabilities. This investigation is contextualised within a broad whole-school as well as specific HPE context. Students draw upon interdisciplinary knowledge developed in first year to explore exemplars of policies and practice as they continue to build knowledge of varied approaches to HPE in the school and community. Students examine the general capabilities including literacy, numeracy and ICT with a focus on those relevant to HPE in Victorian schools and the way they inform teaching and learning in schools. Through combining theory and practice across discipline areas, students continue to enhance their understanding of the wider educational settings, cross-curricular priorities, general capabilities and other programming and planning priorities in HPE.",

The study of motor control and skill acquisition is a broad area that uses foundational biophysical knowledge together with elements of psychology, sociology and understanding of growth and development to explore how and why the human body moves. Students are introduced to concepts such as tacit knowledge and environmental constraints to understand the dynamic interaction between body and environment in the production of high-level skilled sporting and lifetime physical activity movements. The unit also investigates how movement abilities can be diverse due to a range of factors beyond the immediate control of the individual. Students develop a theoretical foundation to underpin many practical approaches common to sports coaching and movement settings. Practical application of theoretical understandings provides students with an appreciation for how they might plan for, implement and evaluate a range of approaches to learning motor skills.",

In this context, developing understandings of how curriculum can be collaborative between school and those with a stake in the provision of health, sporting and movement outcomes, will support learners and educators to locate and navigate local, regional and global resources to enhance physical activity and health management. The unit draws upon theoretical understandings of the terms community and partnerships to prepare educators as knowledge brokers, capable of negotiating community resources and learning collaborations, including for example with local government, sporting organisations and digital communities of practice. In addition, the unit introduces innovative teaching and learning approaches that adopt partnership models within health and physical education. Planning for quality community partnerships enables students to continue to develop their professional practice and identity as teachers, and make connections between curriculum, teaching, learning and communities.",

Students are challenged to consider their role as ethical leaders and change makers, and plan what resources, support, networks and ongoing professional learning they may need to progress performance. The unit engages students in critical reflection to explore current dominant policies and pedagogies within HPE and how these may shape and influence their practice. It prepares students to engage professionally with colleagues, parents/carers and the community with an understanding of the overarching legislative, administrative and organisational policies and processes. In doing so, it supports students to better understand the processes of changing practice within HPE at a policy, school and individual level. Case study and workshop activities examine relations that exist within the education context. Barriers and opportunities to initiating and sustaining change are critiqued and unpacked using various theoretical lenses.",

Drawing on a range of Australian and international research literature, and linking theory and practice, students work collaboratively and individually to develop deep understandings of language and literacy (including numerical literacy) as complex social, cultural, political and technological practices that develop in multiple contexts, in and out of schools and classrooms. They apply their emerging knowledge and skills in these areas to creatively and critically inquire into a range of educational scenarios involving literacy development and learning. Students learn about and undertake ethnographic research into their own literacy practices, and those of students and teachers in diverse educational contexts. In learning from research and through conducting their own inquiries, students develop an appreciation of how language and literacy practices play key roles in mediating diverse learners' identities, relationships and understandings of the world.",

These considerations are situated within a variety of theoretical and practical contexts such as ethical and social theories, harm minimisation, citizenship, globalisation, critical media literacy and health literacy. Contemporary content covered within an Australian context includes topics such as poverty, mental health, drug use, communicable disease, conflict and climate change with a focus on sustainability and health equality. The unit seeks to challenge students to move beyond borders in order to think creatively about twenty-first century health challenges and to become compassionate, empathetic and critically responsive health professionals equipped with a global outlook on the complex factors that contribute to a sustainable future for all.",

This enables students to develop a sophisticated understanding of the issues associated with diversity and inclusion. In practical sessions, the unit develops students' knowledge on differentiating their delivery to meet the learning needs of diverse participants, including those from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage, and people with disabilities. Students develop understanding of how inclusive delivery of sport and physical activity can contribute to a more equitable and sustainable world. The practical sessions develop strategies to support students to deliver sport and physical activity in ways that are ethical, foster participation and are challenging for all. They encourage students to reflect on their practice, developing skills to become advocates for inclusive delivery in their future work.",

Human movement science represents a unique discipline that explores human performance in relation to a range of movement challenges. Students develop advanced skills, knowledge and capabilities relevant to sport and exercise science that will enable them to become actors in the critique, interpretation, planning and design of existing sporting, performance, rehabilitation and health related concerns. The unit provides opportunities to examine how particular practices based upon foundational biophysical knowledge have historically emerged, been continually challenged and reinterpreted. Students gain practical experience in both laboratory and field-based settings related to the monitoring and execution of sporting, performance, rehabilitation and health-related practices.",

This is focused on examining practice in an education setting, school or classroom, using methods that may include focus groups, interviews, self-study, action research or participant observation. Finally, students demonstrate a clear and coherent exposition of the knowledge they have gained through the presentation of their findings to their peers and in a written report.",

Drawing on a range of research literature and the knowledge, skills and professional experiences developed during all years of their course, students are inducted into the notion of what it means to be engaged in the teaching profession through consideration of the nature of teachers' work and of leadership in education. This includes the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and personal dimensions of the work of teachers and educational leaders. Students gather evidence of and critically reflect on their emerging professional identity as practitioners, and on the Graduate Teaching Standards and graduate attributes they have developed that enable them to be skilled teachers and potential education leaders. They explore the ways in which they can engage with and initiate professional communities of educators in and beyond their immediate professional settings. Students develop understanding of the process of applying for positions and transitioning to the profession in ways that enhance and improve their employability. They continue to develop their literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology (ICT) skills and knowledge through synthesising a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives they have encountered throughout their course.",
