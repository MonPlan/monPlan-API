From the perspective of broader educational settings (school, community, early childhood settings, home), the important questions of what learning is, how and why learning occurs, what quality learning might be and what influences learning, are discussed and reflected upon. Through examination of different theoretical perspectives and contexts, this unit focuses on building an understanding of what can influence learning and offers skill building in academic learning. Ideas closely associated with learning, including motivation, engagement and ability are also considered. The unit encourages students to begin constructing deep knowledge about the relationship between learning and educational inquiry.",

It builds students' understanding of the psychological, motivational, social, cognitive, biological and socio-cultural perspectives of child and adolescent development and the possible implications for learning. Students inquire into strategies for learning and teaching with children and adolescents based on contemporary knowledge of development and fostering positive behaviour interactions and relationships for diverse learners. They develop understanding of how to develop a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers and other community service and health providers in the educative process.",

This unit focuses on the range of ways children encounter and use literacy in a diverse social, cultural and technological world. It introduces conceptual frameworks for understanding and critiquing the processes of how children learn about literacy. Students explore the importance of translating home and community learning into various institutional settings and vice versa. The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives, and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children's literacy learning. With a particular focus on the early years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children's oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies, taking into account issues related to information and communication technology.",

They explore and utilise education programs which have successfully engaged with learners from Indigenous and traditionally oriented societies and achieved improvements in their education outcomes. Students also develop broad knowledge, understanding and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their histories, cultures and languages, to meet expectations in the Australian Curriculum and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. They develop skills and insights into how to engage learners from Indigenous and traditional communities and create successful partnerships that improve academic outcomes and foster reconciliation.",

Drawing on their learning in university coursework and through professional experience in varied education settings, students explore what it means to be engaged in the education profession through consideration of the nature of teachers' and educators' work and of leadership in education. They explore policy and practice involved in the ethical, professional, industrial, legal, emotional, intellectual and physical dimensions of the work of teachers and educators in multiple contexts.",

This unit focuses on developing coherent and advanced knowledge in relation to literacy teaching in a diverse social, cultural and technological world. Building on previous work, students continue to explore and critique various conceptual frameworks and theoretical ideas that help them to understand how children continue to develop various literacy knowledges, skills and understandings. The teaching of literacy is examined from a number of current theoretical perspectives and students develop appropriate pedagogical practices that support children's literacy learning. With a particular focus on the middle and upper primary years, the unit explores effective pedagogies to enhance children's oral language, reading, writing and visual literacies taking into account issues related to information and communication technologies (ICT).",

Important conceptual scientific ideas and different pedagogical approaches to the teaching of science and technology are critiqued. The preparation and teaching of science and technology programs is undertaken in the context of studying teaching strategies that are appropriate across cultural contexts, for different science and technology concepts and across year levels in primary school, early childhood settings, homes and communities.",

Students develop an understanding of the concepts of environmental studies and sustainability and explore how these concepts are inextricably linked. They learn how to develop integrated approaches to studies of the environment and sustainability and specific related science content across primary school curriculum. Students investigate and understand the cultural, social, economic, scientific, ecological and political factors that influence attitudes and actions towards environment and sustainability. They develop theoretical, discipline-based and pedagogical knowledge and understanding of how to implement whole school approaches and classroom learning experiences for environment and sustainability at different levels of primary education.",
