The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

Geometric and economic tolerancing is further explored. The use of solid modeling software to simulate the behaviour of mechanical devices and produce engineering drawings is introduced. The integration of design skills and related engineering studies is covered through a group exercise to design a mechanical device.",

Laboratory experiments and hands-on instruction in the digital simulation package Matlab to solve models. A unified approach to mathematical modelling via the concepts of resistance, capacitance and inertia/inductance is emphasised. Students learn to perform system modelling, develop solution, assess a system response and analyse systems.",
