We examine the role of functional groups in biological molecules of biomedical importance and common reactions in metabolism. We reinforce concepts of ionisation and pH. We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

Microstructural features governing fatigue, fracture and failure of structures will be explored and the extent to which we can predict failure outlined, including design against failure, critical crack size, low and high cycle fatigue. Microstructural toughening, effects of welds and thermal stability of materials will be addressed in terms of mitigation or minimization of structural defects.",

It engenders an appreciation of the role and responsibility of the engineer in management of risk - be it economic or personal (through design, manufacturing and use). The role of materials identification and selection and the impact on function and environment is covered. In addition it looks at the role computers play in all facets of the current engineering environment, including the key areas of design, analysis, machining and robotics. It seeks to give students practical skills in these areas, in particular in the area of computer-aided drafting.",

The techniques can be broadly split into direct (imaging, chemical analysis) and indirect (scattering) techniques. The principles underlying techniques such as x-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy, photoelectron or mass spectroscopy are explained. Students will investigate the design of experiments, testing for relationships among variables and curve fitting. Models will be related to the characterisation techniques studied by the application of appropriate models to real data.",

Selection of an appropriate thermomechanical processing schedule in order to achieve the required microstructure and properties of steels will be discussed. The second part of the unit will introduce ceramic processing technologies including green body shaping, solid state sintering, liquid phase sintering, hot-pressing and sol-gel processing. Microstructures of ceramics and their effects on the materials properties will be presented.",
