We examine the role of functional groups in biological molecules of biomedical importance and common reactions in metabolism. We reinforce concepts of ionisation and pH. We discuss the chemistry of proteins and their physical properties in solution leading up to an examination of enzyme catalysis and kinetics. This lays the foundation for an examination of the biological oxidation of fats and carbohydrates that provides the cell with energy. We examine the way energy is stored in times of plenty and relate our understanding to normal and disease states that occur.",

The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

It includes use of design software tools for 3D modeling, assembly, finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and design optimization. Topics on manufacturing processes will incorporate the discussion of a variety of modern computer controlled processes in addition to those relating to composites and polymers. The unit will emphasize design methodologies and processes for low cost, manufacturability, ease of assembly and speed to market.",

Geometric and economic tolerancing is further explored. The use of solid modeling software to simulate the behaviour of mechanical devices and produce engineering drawings is introduced. The integration of design skills and related engineering studies is covered through a group exercise to design a mechanical device.",
