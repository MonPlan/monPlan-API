In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight.",

Efficiency and performance of aircraft engines based on piston and gas turbine platforms is examined along with piston and turboprop engines and propeller design for subsonic speed. For jets and turbofan engines, nozzle design for transonic to supersonic speed is covered, as are supersonic engines. The unit concludes with an introduction to rocket motors and their design and performance for both atmospheric and space flight.",
