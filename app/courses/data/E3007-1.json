The curriculum focuses on general and physical chemistry principles which in turn complements the synthetic chemistry topics discussed in the subsequent unit, CHM1022. On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.",

Students will obtain an understanding of triple bottom line reporting as a driver for management, involving financial, environmental and the social impact of business. Financial management will include project management, project risk, market analysis, project costing and finance and financial indicators. Environmental management will look at the approval process for new projects and on-going environmental improvement strategies. Social management will look at company organisation, the role of unions, occupational health and safety law and safety management.",
