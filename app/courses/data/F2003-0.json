                    "Description": "This unit examines the medium and its materiality across a range of visual art practices including: painting, sculpture, installation, photography, video, multi-media, social practices and performance art. It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies. It introduces students to the critical dialogue around the medium and artists' material processes.",

The unit covers a range of material concerns: sculptural, painterly, filmic, performative, durational, conceptual and so on. Themes may change in different years, but include such questions as \"What is contemporary art?\", \"How do we define aesthetics after conceptualism?\" and \"How can art be political today?\" The course also covers institutional concerns, such as methods of dissemination, global reach, biennales, gallery contexts and curatorial implications. With help from teaching staff, students are encouraged to focus the assessment tasks on the concerns of their studio practice or art writing and art history interests.",
