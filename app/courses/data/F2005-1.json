Through using research processes appropriate to their discipline, students will investigate contemporary issues that penetrate the links between design, society and the environment. They will be required to use their research to uncover existing knowledge; use it to articulate and substantiate an argument; and build on it to formulate their own critically informed ideas. Through acquired research skills students will be able to interrogate a range of contemporary design issues drawn from the perceived moral dichotomies of design: useful/useless, social conscience/private indulgence, essential need/unnecessary consumption, luxury/necessity, and so on.",
