It elaborates on architectural design as a process of investigation, critical observation, and experiment. It increases the emphasis on design as a synthetic process encompassing a range of complex issues inherent in the production of architecture. The unit introduces students to design-based research. Studies in the unit will maintain a focus on developing design as a visual language and process of cultural production with an emphasis on social and environmental sustainability.",

This includes study of principles of integrated design and the implications of these in relation to architectural design, pan-disciplinary collaboration and construction processes and outcomes. The building will be considered as a site of collaboration of pan-disciplinary teams of experts, whose input contributes to the integrity of the whole. Physical, visual and performative integration of building performance systems will be considered in terms of their relationship to design intent. Integral to the subject matter are the implications of tighter integration in relation to strategies for environmental sustainability and optimisation in architectural design and construction. Through project-based exercises, students also engage with the professional ethics and practices required for project development and the performative integration of building systems and design intent.",
