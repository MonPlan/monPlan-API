There is a detailed study of the elements of the tort of negligence - namely, duty of care, breach of duty, causation, defences and the assessment of damages - and the particular problems raised by negligently caused mental harm and pure economic loss. Students will also consider the principles and rationale of vicarious liability.

On completion of CHM1011, students will have gained an understanding of how atoms and molecules interact with each other and how this affects their bonding, reactivity, 3D structure and physical properties. A number of important topics such as stoichiometry, intermolecular forces, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibria, and electrochemistry will be developed in order to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops and tutorials are complemented through a laboratory program where students will have the opportunity to develop analytical techniques and design their own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.",

The unit compares review of the 'merits' of administrative actions, by administrative tribunals, with review of their 'legality', by courts, pursuant to judicial review. The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application. The unit aims, particularly, to develop students' practical skills in interpreting statutes.",

It examines principles of criminal responsibility including corporate criminal responsibility, and offences against the property interests of a range of legal persons.  It also examines drug offences, as well as the significant role criminal laws play in regulating behaviour through strict liability and inchoate offences. It then considers procedural steps in the criminal process, including the role of discretion and mechanisms for accountability.",

The unit also examines the way that lawyers' ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering. Students will also be expected to critically assess the way lawyers' ethics are regulated in the context of multiple approaches to legal ethics and disparate practice contexts.",

The unit begins with understanding disturbances, why disturbances need to be controlled and possible responses of various systems to a disturbance. The selection of which variables to control, which variables to manipulate and approaches to interactions are covered, together with the most important types of control loops and computer control systems. Topics include common control scenarios - feed back, feed forward, and cascade systems; ratio control; tuning of PID controllers; single loop and multiple loop systems;  interactions and decoupling; process simulation and advanced process control.",
