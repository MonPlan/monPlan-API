There is a detailed study of the elements of the tort of negligence - namely, duty of care, breach of duty, causation, defences and the assessment of damages - and the particular problems raised by negligently caused mental harm and pure economic loss. Students will also consider the principles and rationale of vicarious liability.

The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application.

It allows students to translate real-world forces into abstract form for engineering modelling of a range of common problems found in industry and gain knowledge of the relationship between analysis and design. Students will be exposed to a wide range of analytical tools and modeling philosophies. To complement these analytical solution techniques, students will now be taught the fundamentals of finite element analysis.",

Using control volume analysis the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy are developed leading to the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Techniques employed to solving these equations for specific problems are explored. Methods of exact and approximate solutions of these equations, and the use of conceptual and analytical tools such as flow similitude, vorticity, circulation, stream function and velocity potential are described. The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed. The Unit introduces the concepts underpinning the broad areas of fluid acoustics, computational fluid dynamics, environmental fluid mechanics and wind energy.",

It is a full year project of either a major design, theoretical, or experimental investigation. The project may be undertaken either within the department or externally with a company or research organisation. In either case, an academic member of staff will act as the supervisor. While some projects may benefit from group based work it is expected that students will work individually on each project.",
