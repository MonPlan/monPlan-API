It introduces the sources of authoritative law - statutes, delegated legislation and judicial precedents.  A case series is used to demonstrate the evolution of the common law within the constraints of the doctrine and practice of precedent.  The unit provides foundational knowledge and skills in the interpretation of judicial precedents and legislation and their application in legal problem-solving.  Students develop fundamental skills in legal research and legal writing.",

There is a detailed study of the elements of the tort of negligence - namely, duty of care, breach of duty, causation, defences and the assessment of damages - and the particular problems raised by negligently caused mental harm and pure economic loss. Students will also consider the principles and rationale of vicarious liability. Throughout the unit, students will explore the impact of statutory law reform, in particular the civil liability reforms, on torts law, in the broader context of how civil wrongs should be redressed.",

The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application.

It introduces different ethical approaches to legal practice, focusing on the justifications for, and criticisms of, the traditional adversarial advocate approach and alternatives to it in the context of different areas of practice. The unit also examines the way that lawyers' ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering. Students will also be expected to critically assess the way lawyers' ethics are regulated in the context of multiple approaches to legal ethics and disparate practice contexts.",
