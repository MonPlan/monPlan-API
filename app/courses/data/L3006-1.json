The unit compares review of the 'merits' of administrative actions, by administrative tribunals, with review of their 'legality', by courts, pursuant to judicial review. The unit examines the judicial review of administrative action both at common law and under statute and has particular regard to the grounds of review; the courts' jurisdiction to entertain applications for review; the possession, by potential applicants for review, of standing; and the remedies available pursuant to a successful judicial review application.

The unit also examines the way that lawyers' ethics and conduct are regulated and set out in legal principles and codes.Students will be encouraged to develop awareness of their own ethical orientation and expected to apply varied ethical approaches to hypothetical scenarios. They will be expected to identify and resolve ethical issues that arise in legal practice using the law of lawyering. Students will also be expected to critically assess the way lawyers' ethics are regulated in the context of multiple approaches to legal ethics and disparate practice contexts.",
