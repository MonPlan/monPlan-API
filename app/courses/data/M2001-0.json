They will be engaged via adult learning teaching and learning principles in this unit as they begin to develop their professional identity. This unit will commence students on the pathway to becoming experts in food (knowledge and application) and culturally competent, self aware healthcare professionals.Food and culture will provide the core content for students to apply, integrate and develop/extend personal and professional attributes and competencies, communication and interpersonal skills. Enhanced cultural awareness for students will be a key outcome of this unit and this will be contextualized as students learn about food/food ingredients, eating patterns, why we eat what we eat and the Australian food supply system. Interprofessional learning opportunities with other healthcare profession students will help strengthen the learning in this unit. Students will be introduced to reflective practice and commence a professional portfolio.",

Therefore the interpretation of information from dietary, laboratory, anthropometric and clinical studies is central to the work of nutrition science students. In this unit, students will examine the methodological applications and limitations surrounding dietary assessment, body composition and biochemical tests. Students will be enabled to critically employ research skills when analysing nutrition related data by identifying appropriate methods, in terms of precision, validity and reproducibility for assessing dietary intake, body composition and nutritional status using biochemical tests. Students will be exposed to a number of anthropometric and dietary intake methods, as well as nutrition screening tools routinely used in both the clinical and research settings.",

The content will explore current public health nutrition practice issues related to priority issues such as obesity, food security and the food supply. A systems based, health promotion framework to addressing priority nutrition issues will be discussed and current public health nutrition practice will be evaluated. Students will explore the political foundations of public health policy in Australia including the impact of public health policies and will develop skills in policy analysis and public health advocacy. This unit will provide students with the foundations knowledge in preparation for the development of skills of the practice of public health nutrition. The key theme explored in this unit is Theme 2: Determinants and influences on population health and nutrition coupled with partial integration of content from Theme 4: Food: from science to systems.",

This unit builds upon the scientific concept of disease aetiology explored in Integrated Science Systems (BND2103) and the critical interpretation of scientific literature and research skills developed in years 1 and 2. Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.Student centered teaching and learning methods will be used to support the delivery of the unit content. Students' participation as adult learners will be encouraged through the curricula with emphasis on extending their scientific communication skills.",
