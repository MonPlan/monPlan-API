The factors that impact the dimensions of health will be critically explored to better understand the roles of government policies, the private sector and communities.

Components of evidence-based practice in occupational therapy will be introduced and practiced. Students will also be introduced to methods of presenting evidence, generating research questions, selecting appropriate quantitative and qualitative research designs, completing data analysis and interpreting data analysis results. Specifically, students will learn the fundamentals of conducting survey questionnaire based research from quantitative perspective and qualitative research using focus group and semi-structured interview methods. This knowledge will enable students to be evidence-based practitioners",
