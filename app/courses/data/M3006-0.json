The unit covers the basic physics of magnetic dipoles and magnetic spin resonance, through to a detailed presentation of the basic gradient and spin echo sequences that are used in medical MRI scanners. The factors that determine the contrast and spatial resolution achievable in MRI are discussed. The FID signal sampling and image reconstruction methods are reviewed, as are the SNR and image artifacts that typically occur in MRI. Patient and MRI staff safety issues are presented. An overview of MRI imaging applications, such as spectroscopic and dynamic imaging is presented.",

Scanning techniques including Doppler ultrasound for the sonographic visualisation of abdominal organs and related structures. Ultrasound artefacts and the bio-effects and bio-hazards of diagnostic ultrasound.Theme 2: Radiographic PracticeOngoing development in general radiography examinations and professional communication to the level of competent practice.  The application and impact of ethics, registration and legal principles to radiographic practice.Theme 3: Breast ImagingThe scientific principles of breast imaging, instrumentation, positioning methods and radiation protection. Principles of breast ultrasound and localisation techniques.Theme 4: Research and Dosimetric TechniquesScientific principles of radiation dosimetry. Calculating the biological effects of ionising radiation. Applications of dosimetry in radiographic practice. Handling quantitative and qualitative data. Using statistical analyses to understand the relevance of data handling and research to radiographic practice.Theme 5: MRI PracticeContraindications for MRI, emergency situations and screening methods. MRI imaging sequences and methods for MRI examinations of the upper abdomen, pelvis and breast.",
