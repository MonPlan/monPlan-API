Students are introduced to historical and contemporary concepts, ideas, and frameworks necessary for critically reflecting on the impact of globalisation across cultures. Key to this reflection will be the development of skills in understanding institutions, cultures and people across a range of local, regional, and global contexts. The unit will enable students to identify, define and describe key global challenges and to apply the interdisciplinary knowledge gained in this unit  to critique and construct knowledge in this area.",

Working through problem-based learning scenarios, students will be expected to demonstrate their knowledge of forms of leadership and their link to addressing questions of global challenges and the drivers of social change. The unit will provide a forum in which students will bring together both discipline-specific and interdisciplinary skills that they have acquired over their study. Students will build on the synthesising of this knowledge to formulate practical and innovative approaches to global challenges.",
