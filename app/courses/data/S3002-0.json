Students will examine the core elements of modern science by looking back at the people, cultures, events and discoveries that allowed science to emerge and contribute to the establishment of key concepts such as empiricism, scepticism and rationalism. This unit will equip students with skills to assess the validity of scientific information, to distinguish between real science, bad science and pseudoscience.  The value of science in solving real world issues and improving the human condition are discussed using current examples. Students are exposed to recent advances in current and emerging research areas through journal presentations. Students will complete assignments that will help improve their written and verbal communication to a range of audiences including scientists, politicians, granting agencies, the general public and scientifically literate generalists, and identifies pathways to becoming a scientific researcher. Students are encouraged to submit their scientific literature reviews for publication in Reinvention, a Journal for Undergraduate Research.",
