The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood.",

The unit is also oriented towards the production of effective and experimental writing, and the importance of reflecting on creative work through the critical techniques of exegesis.",

In a liberal democracy like Australia, its role and function have profound implications for the conduct of politics, the nature of democracy and public policy outcomes. In this unit, the relationship between the media, politics and public policy is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of news media on the policy debate. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated. Particular emphasis is on the structure and operation of media organisations and journalists and how political news is covered. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and political actors. Particular emphasis is on the use of public relations and 'spin doctors' in managing the media as well as the utilisation of political advertising and strategic political communication by governments and political agents.",

Both countries are two of the most powerful and influential countries within the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Developing knowledge of Russian and American politics and societies, students will enhance their understanding of the dynamics of governing ethnically and religiously diverse societies with many competing-and at times sharply antagonistic-interests, and countries with substantial military and economic prowess. The unit closely analyses both countries' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia's conception of 'Sovereign Democracy' and the US' 'American Exceptionalism' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states. Upon completing the subject, students should have also developed a nuanced grasp of the broader field of comparative politics, and its main conceptual approaches and interpretive frameworks-to complement their knowledge of Russian and US politics.",

The first phase introduces the 'Indonesian perspective', with a focus on the archipelago's history, religions and cultures. The second phases familiarizes students with how cultural distance impacts Indonesia's relationship and communication with other regional and global powers. The third and final phase entails a focus on crisis management in the Asian Century. Students firstly encounter case studies of flashpoints and crises in the Australian-Indonesian relationship. Students are then called upon to manage a mock crisis, with the goal of providing a positive outcome through the practical application of cultural literacy.The unit is Indonesian-focused but will be relevant to students more generally concerned with Australia's role in the Asian Century, and how this role influences diplomacy, business and journalism among other fields.",

In particular, our contemporary world is saturated with visual information, and endless debates about the status of literature in the face of visual media. However, such debates are not without precedence. The Renaissance already witnessed emphatic debates on the impact of visual cultures on discourse, literature, and knowledge as a whole. Furthermore, the question of Literature and the Image is not the exclusive battleground of European languages. Indeed, Asian cultures have a similarly complex history of interaction between literature and visual forms, albeit shaped by the nature of differing writing systems. This electives incorporates this crucial global comparative element to explore the following three main areas of study. First, it addresses the History and Theory of literature and visual culture. Second, it explores the concrete forms of visual culture, such as photography and literature, film and literature, combined forms emerging from Surrealism, Avant-Garde and Pop literature, as well as comics and graphic novels. Finally, it provides a comparative perspective by addressing Asian forms of language and visuality, literature and visuality, and comics and manga.",

To facilitate these approaches, students will engage with a teaching team drawn from different Schools in the Faculty of Arts.The unit approaches Beowulf in these specific ways: The historical module outlines the background of the Anglo-Saxon culture that produced the poem, and also discusses how the poem itself has functioned as a vital source of information on the period. The module concludes with discussion on the Old English language in which the poem is written, its poetic form, and the issues surrounding its translation. The literary module considers the manuscript histories of Beowulf, focusing on the remarkable journey the poem has followed to survive into the modern age. Its place in the canon of English literature, its influence and its impact in a variety of media, are also considered as part of this module. The performance module encourages students to consider Beowulf through its status as a performance piece. To conclude the unit, students will be given the opportunity to craft a performative response to sections of the poem.Through these approaches, students not only engage with the poem from different perspective, but encounter and explore diverse practices in a range of academic disciplines.",

What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity.

While these are but one form of monument used to preserve the dead and present their expectations for the next life, they epitomise the importance of preparing for that transition. The unit explores the beliefs that prompted such complex burial arrangements and those for all classes of society, and uses these to chart the development in Egyptian culture from 3050 BCE to 1750 BCE. It explores a wide range of material evidence to track these changes and explores the range of modern theories available to understand the processes involved.",

Such questions will be posed in terms of the political and ideological context of the time: broadly, the gradual but alarming transformation of a static feudal hierarchy into the fluid social order of capitalism, and the challenges posed by (some) women to the limiting assumptions of institutionalized patriarchy.The unit raises fundamental questions such as: What are we looking for in the texts we read? Can we, or should we, use literature to understand what authors and their contemporary readers thought about an issue: using literary texts as sociological and historical artefacts? Or should we, or do we, read an ever-widening circle of texts as an exercise in pleasure-seeking, or as a way of looking for a universal truth about the human condition, or the nature of truth or beauty?Students will be encouraged to consider these question via a series of self-guided explorations of literature from the past, relating texts they have chosen to a corpus of contemporary literature.",

This unit examines the ways Europe came together and rebuilt itself after the ravages of war. Using a variety of disciplinary approaches, this unit explores questions of identity and memory. How did nations choose to present themselves in the contest? What did it mean to win? Did former enemies vote for one another?",

The focus is broadly on the period from 1185 to 1867 when Japan was ruled by a succession of warrior regimes but the unit will also explore the evolution of samurai images and representations primarily in film but also in books, anime, manga, and video games. The central concern is with the evolution of the figure of the samurai across this long period and with the constant tensions between the ideals put forward about the way of the warrior and the actual realities of samurai life.  We will explore the samurai from varied perspectives by considering questions of status, identity, politics, gender, and economics.",

Students are introduced to different approaches to discourse analysis, including Conversation Analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis and Interactional Sociolinguistics, and reflect on the appropriateness of each approach for analysing different types of data and answering different types of research questions.",

In this unit, the politics of the media (understood to mean the politics that goes on within the media as well as the contribution the media makes to politics) is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of newspapers, electronic news media, entertainment, popular culture and so on in that which we might consider 'the political'. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated with particular emphasis on the structure of media ownership in Australia, how this links with patterns of global media political economy, the link between media workers and media managers, and debates about foreign media ownership. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and politics including studies of the dominant trends and themes in media policy.",

Across the centuries as embodied encounters with people framed as the 'other' in world fairs, touring savage shows, wild west shows, and ethnographic displays set the terms of popular cross-cultural understanding. These racialized representations proved to millions of Europeans who witnessed them that the 'savage' was inferior and should be controlled.In the 21st century the inclusion of Indigenous performance in major spectacles such as opening ceremonies of Olympic games by people whose land has been colonised such as Australia and Canada are seen as a symbol of cultural respect.In this unit students will examine Indigenous performance in large scale spectacles from the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries using approaches from performance studies, history and critical race theories to develop a richer understanding of the dynamics intrinsic to the embodied encounter between strangers from different cultural backgrounds and traditions across the last three centuries. Students will explore a range of topics including the fabrication of difference, the invention of the savage and reflect on what has and has not changed.",

Students examine the theoretical underpinnings of digital literature in poststructuralist, cyberculture and contemporary media theories, as well as performing textual analysis of examples from major genres (hypertext fiction; networked writing; analogue-print hybrids; interactive fiction; and social-media narrative). The unit emphasises the constantly-evolving relationship between digital technologies and literary creators' uses of them. We will also consider issues of longevity and canonicity for digital literatures given the rapid rate of obsolescence in digital platforms.",

Students will come to appreciate that practice-led research is concerned with the nature of practice and leads to new knowledge that has operational significance for that practice and cultural policy. They will consider and debate the specific research problem at the core of the researcher's current project, exposing students to the rigorous scholarship and methodologies such as action research. They will consider the relevance of practice-led research for social and cultural theory. The results of their study may be communicated in text form such as a traditional research essay or as a creative outcome. In addition, students will be given the opportunity to reflect on their experience, and to meet with high profile researchers and media practitioners in small groups, where they are able to ask questions and share their experience.",

We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling.

Help students understand the symbiotic potential of traditionally distinct disciplines. Engage students fully with 'active' learning.  It will be faithful to the notion that participation and experiential learning foster a deeper understanding of complex material. Enhance and consolidate students' academic and research abilities, while also stimulating team-work and collaboration, thus creating a pool of transferable skills that students can acquire and practice.

Of particular interest are: peace and development journalism, civic or participatory journalism, and environmental reporting. Students will explore the rationale behind each of these news forms, the values that inform them, and their capacity to humanise and localise the victims of the fissures of geography, ethnicity and wealth. Through case studies in mainstream and alternative European and global news coverage, students will learn to approach news not as a series of discrete violent events but rather as part of complex, ongoing, global processes of social and environmental change. Further, by drawing from scholarly literature in Journalism and Media Studies, field trips and practical research techniques, students will evaluate the significance of people power to journalism while producing in-depth investigations of their own.",

Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting.

It examines changes at all linguistics levels - vocabulary, meaning, sounds and grammar. Examples are drawn from the history of a wide range of languages - Germanic, Romance, Pacific and Asian. Part of the subject also gives students practice in reconstructing lost stages of languages, using the internal and comparative methods of reconstruction.",

In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.",

You'll research a topic from your own family history, from resources provided by Museum Victoria (MV), or from a previous unit. You'll do oral history interviews and research photos, objects, documents and other sources. You'll storyboard and script your own history video. In the final month we will work together in computer labs as each student produces their digital video, which will be placed on a Making History website and then showcased at a Museum event for students, family and friends.

These racialized representations proved to millions of Europeans who witnessed them that the 'savage' was inferior and should be controlled.In the 21st century the inclusion of Indigenous performance in major spectacles such as opening ceremonies of Olympic games by people whose land has been colonised such as Australia and Canada are seen as a symbol of cultural respect.In this unit students will examine Indigenous performance in large scale spectacles from the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries using approaches from performance studies, history and critical race theories to develop a richer understanding of the dynamics intrinsic to the embodied encounter between strangers from different cultural backgrounds and traditions across the last three centuries.

Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain's loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century.",

The European Union is commonly seen to have been an antidote to war, ushering in an era of Kantian peace; a view powerfully endorsed by the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU in 2012.  Despite the strength of this view, recent research suggests it is possible to look at the relationship between peace and European unity differently.  In fact, European unity has been propelled by war since 1945: not just at the founding moment at the end of the Second World War (NATO, EEC, WEU), but by anti-colonial nationalists pushing European powers towards pro-active European policies, and in EU responses to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia (OSCE, CFSP), Iraq, Libya and challenges posed by refugee movements and global terrorism. An unintended consequence of the logic of deeper integration has been the consolidation of a European identity amongst some elites, whilst political and popular support for the EU has weakened.  This last development poses serious questions about the future shape the state system in what remains a major player in regimes of global governance.",

These may include comparative and transnational history, global history, borderlands studies, migration studies, the history of tourism and travel and Atlantic history. The unit aims to introduce students to the dramatic impact of such approaches in opening up new areas of historical investigation as well as revising existing interpretations of the past in a range of fields. We will also examine the methodological and practical challenges faced by historians who look beyond the framework of the nation, from periodization to use of sources to publication.",

Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world.

Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in drastically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible.This unit examines a selection of programming languages and paradigms and explores the evolution of language design from low-level paradigms that are closer to the execution model of the machine, to more high-level declarative paradigms that allow programmers to model a problem precisely rather than specify its solution. The unit covers paradigms such as functional and logic programming, comparing and contrasting them to programming styles that students are already familiar with, including object-oriented, imperative and procedural programming paradigms. Topics include specification and data-modeling techniques (covering types and polymorphism, mutability-versus-purity, state management, and side-effects) and different models of execution such as strict-versus-lazy evaluation.The unit provides practical experience with a variety of non-procedural, non-object-oriented programming languages and discusses the influence of programming language theory on the design of current main-stream computer languages, and how the theory translates to practice.",

It also addresses the risks associated with the application of big data analytics in government and big business to support greater surveillance of citizen by state and consumers by business, disempower individuals and vulnerable communities, support discrimination, threaten social inclusion, social justice, human and civil rights, self-determination and privacy, and widen the divide between the data haves and have-nots.The unit will cover: introduction to social, cultural and heritage informatics; building digital media/data ecosystems and using data technologies to achieve the benefits and mitigate the risks of big data; developing socio-legal and policy frameworks to ensure transparency, good governance, accountability and ethical practice; big data rights regimes - rights in data, rights to self determination, privacy rights, access rights, discovery rights, IP and copyright; use of big data to support resilient, sustainable communities and cultures.",

These conditions are mainly diagnosed and managed in this setting. As previous reports in the literature have expressed concern about the level of under-diagnosis and the 'low treated prevalence' of patients with mental disorders (which included depression and anxiety), the aim of this unit is to enable students to increase their skills assessing, identifying and managing patients with mental ill-health - specifically depressive and anxiety disorders.The acquisition of skills and confidence that students are expected to develop in this unit will then hopefully make a difference to clinical practice and patients, translating into better patient outcomes, both in terms of the quality of care provided and the number of affected patients that are provided with assistance.",

Health professionals working with children in this age group require knowledge and skills which are different to those skills utilised when managing adults. The child health unit recognises this need and aims to build on the existing knowledge of health professionals who work with children in the primary health care setting. It addresses aspects of child health commonly encountered in primary care and includes the initial management of common paediatric emergencies and developmental assessments. The child health unit focuses on a systematic and evidence-based approach to child health issues, comprehensive management plans that include carers of children and various health professionals, and the assessment and management of children in the context of their psychosocial and physical environment.The child health unit has been designed for general practitioners, family medicine specialists, nurses and allied health professionals who work with children in the primary health care setting. The child health unit runs over 12 sessions. It is run as an interactive case-based and clinically-focussed unit to ensure relevance to all students of varying health professional backgrounds and geographical location. By the completion of the child health unit, students should be well equipped with the knowledge and skills for the systematic assessment and initial management of common presentations within the student's own primary health care setting.",

Midwifery practice in Australia and overseas is increasingly faced with women requiring technological solutions to complex clinical situations. Obstetrics as a profession is shrinking in numbers, and the impact of a lack of professional indemnity insurance has forced the reordering of maternity services. Government policies and reports advocate for an increased role for midwifery in the provision of maternity services at all levels of risk. In many countries around the world midwifery is at the forefront of a range of complexity of maternity care, but the preparation of midwives for complex practice is ad hoc and poorly realised.This Unit aims to prepare midwives with the knowledge for skills development in complex clinical situations. The unit is structured to allow flexibility and individualisation of the content to better meet the needs of individual practitioners and their practice settings. Theoretical knowledge will include pathophysiology, technology, evidence and practice issues related to skills clusters. These clusters include: Prenatal, Perinatal, Postnatal and High Risk.Opportunities will be given for students to participate in an inter-professional workshop with medical students to acquire some complex clinical skills. Students will understand the requirement and processes necessary for evidence based practice and will gain skills for its implementation in an environment that might be resistant. Students will have the opportunity to critique self and context in relation to evidence in practice. Students will also identify potential for developing collegial and collaborative relationships to other maternity service providers within a practice setting (eg medical practitioners, allied health professionals, nurses and community groups).

The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities.",

With a greater appreciation of the action of drugs on body processes, students will be able to determine which medications should be administered to particular patients in order to ensure therapeutic effects are optimized and adverse effects are minimized. Students will articulate the key pharmacological characteristics of drug classes, as well as derive an understanding of specific features of individual drugs.The second module extends students' knowledge of social, political and ethical principles of medication management, and allows the student to explore how these principles are applied in the advanced practice setting. The concepts of pain management, adverse drug reactions and medication use across the lifespan will be considered. Students will individualise the use of the clinical decision making process as the framework for gathering and organizing medication information, planning, prescribing, administering, documenting and evaluation to suit their own practice needs. Students will extend their knowledge of the learning and teaching strategies for patient education and the government policies that are relevant to nurse prescribing. Commonwealth and State laws affecting the control of medication will also be applied to the advanced practice setting. Students will address the socio-cultural and ethical issues that affect the relationship between the nurse practitioner and patient, and will examine the style and required particulars for written prescriptions.

The program incorporates advanced education in qualitative and quantitative research methodologies through the development and completion of a research project. The research project undertaken will require students to formulate a research aim and/or question/s, complete a literature review, design an appropriate methodology to answer the research question/s, complete an ethics application, and gather and analyse the required data, discuss the results in relation to pertinent literature and professional practice, and develop conclusions and recommendations. The Honours program has been structured to enable students to understand research in the context of the issues of interest of concern in a specific organisation or service area. They will also develop an understanding of how the research project applies to the wider community. Hence each occupational therapy Honours project has a 'host' organisation which has a fieldwork responsibility. The student works in collaboration with the host organisation, the Monash university academic supervisor/s and other stakeholders.In OCC3072 students will spend up to two days per week in the organisation to develop the research proposal as well as engage in fieldwork activities. In OCC4091, students will spend a further up to two days per week in the organisation where the research proposal developed in OCC3072 will be implemented.",

Through the completion of a community placement, our students have the opportunity to observe the outstanding human skills of multi-disciplinary teams in a community setting and be actively involved in the work of the host agency. Through the project, students have a specific opportunity to explore community responses to social justice issues; reflect upon their own attitudes and behaviours; and relate these to an evolving understanding of the relationship between medicine, pharmacy, healthcare professionalism and social justice. The project requires students to consider their own knowledge, values and skills in relation to the impact of political, social, and economic determinants on people's lives. It will allow students to better understand the use of contemporary approaches in service delivery, and it will also serve as an opportunity to explore alternative strategies to health and well-being of their patients in their future practice.The project provides students with an opportunity to gain a unique learning experience off-campus, based within a community organisation involved in the provision of clinical, health and social care to needy individuals (see Appendix A for list of organisations). Practical involvement with their community-based placements provide an opportunity for students to understand what these organisations do, why they need to do so and how they serve individuals, families and communities. This community-centred approach will allow pharmacy students to experience health and social care issues at a grassroots level.Students will undertake a group project in their community placement under guidance of academic convenors (AA) from Monash University and field educator (FE) from the organisations involved. Both AA and FE will provide support, guidance and manage academic progress of the students' projects They will also assist students during the planning and implementation of the projects. The students will also develop skills in communicating their project work orally, visually, and in written form to fellow students, faculty, and community groups or organisations with whom they will be working.

It considers the various roles you fulfil as a health science professional.  Learning in clinical settings explores how students and new graduates learn as well as what they learn, including cognitive and organisational psychology, higher education and professional education.  The relationship between clinical educators and learners during clinical placements and issues around learning in the workplace are covered, including legal and ethical issues related to learners' participation in clinical settings. The differences between the clinical educator role and mentoring role are explored with both formal and informal mentoring relationships and their benefits and potential pitfalls.",

The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of human-service organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations. They will also be introduced to other notions of leadership in social work - leadership through research, advocacy and community action.Subsequently, theories of leadership will be placed against the experiences and views of current social work leaders in this sector, who will be active participants in this unit, so that students gain some understanding of what leadership comprises, what priority actual leaders place on the various aspects of leadership, and what research and theory underpins actual leadership in the policy development, planning and delivery of social services today.",

Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of humanservice organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations. They will also be introduced to other notions of leadership in social work - leadership through research, advocacy and community action.Subsequently, theories of leadership will be placed against the experiences and views of current social work leaders in this sector, who will be active participants in this unit, so that students gain some understanding of what leadership comprises, what priority actual leaders place on the various aspects of leadership, and what research and theory underpins actual leadership in the policy development, planning and delivery of social services today.",

Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework.",
