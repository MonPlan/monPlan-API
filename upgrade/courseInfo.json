Students can choose from the full range of arts disciplines and interdisciplinary programs taught by schools and centres in the Faculty of Arts., Monash arts students learn about the diverse world in which we live, and how we might live in the future. They are encouraged to think about cultural, linguistic and geographical difference and to ask how and why these variations have occurred over time. Studying arts encourages students to take an innovative approach in tackling world issues and fosters a global perspective. Arts students think about how communication works, how people make themselves understood to others, and how they , make meaning through artistic expression. Arts students have the ability to assess evidence, and the research skills to acquire information. They use these skills to find out why we are the way we are., To do this, they need to think critically and creatively. Arts students are self-reliant researchers, seeking out a variety of resources in order to answer complicated questions. They are expert communicators who can convey complex ideas in speech and writing. They resist easy answers, or simplistic solutions., Arts students strive to develop an ethical and intellectual framework within which they can understand what it means to be human, and how this changes over time.",

Our facilities feature a commercial kitchen, exercise and fitness studio, phlebotomy room, sleep laboratory, body composition, metabolic testing and anthropometric suites plus consulting rooms., The course is accredited by the Dietitians Association of Australia and meets its national competency standards for entry-level dieticians. Graduates are eligible to become Accredited Practicing Dietitians., *Note that students will not be admitted directly into this course in 2016. Instead high achieving students (ATAR 90+) seeking a DAA accredited course for dietitians, will be admitted into the Bachelor of Nutrition Science Scholars , Program as explained below., Monash University has developed a new two year Master of Dietetics. The process for full Dieticians Association of Australian (DAA) accreditation of the new Masters has begun but it is a rigorous and lengthy process, not expected to be completed until 2017. The University's aim is to achieve accreditation prior to graduation of the first cohort of Scholars. All inquiries regarding the progress of the program's accreditation review should be directed to the Monash University Dietetic Program Coordinator., Students admitted to the Bachelor of Nutrition Science Scholars Program will have the following potential outcomes:, 1. Immediate enrolment as Scholars in the Bachelor of Nutrition Science. If the Masters of Dietetics is accredited by the DAA by the end of 2017, Scholars who complete the Bachelor of Nutrition Science with an average grade of Credit or above are guaranteed entry into the Master of Dietetics in 2019 (supported by CSP or equivalent) , with subject credits that mean the Masters may be completed in 1.5 years full time. Graduates of this combined 4.5 year program will be awarded a Bachelor of Nutrition Science (Scholars Program) and the DAA accredited Master of Dietetics., 2. If the Master of Dietetics is not accredited by the DAA by the end of 2017, Scholars will be transferred to the Bachelor of Nutrition and Dietetics, a 4 year DAA accredited course, at the end of 2017. Graduates of this 4 year program will be awarded the DAA accredited Bachelor of Nutrition and Dietetics (Honours)., Students who do not qualify for the scholars' program may be offered admission to the Bachelor of Nutrition Science and, as graduates, will be eligible to compete for entry into the 1.5 year Masters in Dietetics.",

This provides students with time for self-directed study, the time and opportunity to be in control of their own learning, and to develop skills in problem-solving and the critical appraisal of information., This degrees will be awarded at the honours standard. The grading of this award is based on academic achievement., === The Themes ===, The course has a four-theme structure. These themes are:, +  Theme 1 - Personal and professional development , +  Theme 2 - Population, society, health and illness , +  Theme 3 - Scientific basis of clinical practice, +  Theme 4 - Clinical skills, The four themes run through all years of the course, but will not be of equal weight; nor will they be of constant weight throughout the course., ==== Theme 1 ====, 'Personal and professional development' will focus on the doctor as an individual. This theme concentrates on the personal attributes and , qualities needed by medical students and, ultimately, medical practitioners. It covers elements of health enhancement, professional responsibilities, communication skills, information technology, medical informatics and computing skills, ethics and legal issues, and clinical effectiveness., ==== Theme 2 ==== , 'Population, society, health and illness' develops students' abilities to deal with broader society and population issues. Students will consider the social, environmental and behavioural contexts of illness and the practice of medicine, including an emphasis on rural and remote Australia. Other elements of this theme will be built around research skills, critical analysis, health promotion, epidemiology, public health, community diversity, population and global health, and a range of other societal issues. The history and philosophy of the scientific approach to medicine will also be included, extending this to approaches to knowledge and information, and an , understanding of evidence-based medicine. , ==== Theme 3 ==== , 'Scientific basis of clinical practice' includes much of the human systems-based teaching in the course. The knowledge and concepts that underpin medicine, both in the basic medical sciences and in the clinical sciences, will be delivered within this theme. In later years, students are expected to develop more advanced knowledge in a self-selected discipline area relevant to their clinical placement. , ==== Theme 4 ==== , The 'Clinical skills' theme encompasses the whole range of clinical skills. Practice in clinical skills (including procedural skills) is stressed early and often. The approach in clinical skills development will be to develop defined clinical competencies. This will begin with clinical aspects of communication skills and move through history taking and physical examinations to the more advanced clinical and procedural skills., === Rural practice ===, The five-year curriculum will include an , experience in rural areas for all students. This includes one day in a rural community in first year and a two-week rural program undertaken in Year 2 of the course., ==Awarding of honours grade==, Students completing this degree may receive an overall honours grade based on a high level of academic achievement., The honours grade is recorded in the unit MED5100 (Final MBBS grade) and is calculated from the results achieved in units studied as follows:, + 60 per cent of the result achieved for MED4000 , + 30 per cent of the result achieved for MED2000, + 10 per cent of the overall average results achieved in year 5 of the course., Students will receive an honours grade for the following scores:, + H1 - a result of 80 per cent or higher , + H2A - 79-75 per cent.",

These units include a series of defined and self-directed design projects that can engage with design systems, services, processes, environments and artefacts. Students are required to demonstrate high-level planning, resourcing, implementation and evaluation, informing the development of an expert understanding of professional design processes. The course engages students in design research processes and permits them the opportunity to personally contribute to the development of their discipline., Students may select a particular design studio specialisation within the course, or they may enrol in the advanced studies in design specialisation and select units , from across a number of areas:, + Advanced studies in design, + Collaborative design, + Interaction design, + Multimedia design., In addition to the core design studios, a unit in design thinking initiates the development of individual design research strategies. Three further units build capability in design research, management, entrepreneurialism, culminating in an exegesis. Two selective units complement the core studies by extending relevant discipline skills and knowledge. Teaching methodologies consists of studio sessions, creative and technical laboratories, lectures, tutorials and research seminars., ==Specialisations ==, ===Advanced studies in design===, If you prefer a broadly applicable advanced design qualification you may choose, with the approval of your course coordinator, a selection of units from each level across the specialisation streams. This means you will refine your own studies by selecting from collaborative design, interaction design or multimedia , design., This enables you to tailor your unit choices while addressing the fundamental principles of advanced design practice and thinking. It will challenge you to connect research and practice across the design disciplines to become a highly thoughtful and engaged design practitioner. Throughout your studies you will build your learning by broadening your knowledge of key design constructs, deepening your professional learning in design areas of interest, and advancing your capacity as a design professional. The final semester of study provides the opportunity for you to pursue a major self-initiated project, or extend your skills by participating in a leading industry project., ===Collaborative design===, The collaborative design specialisation brings together expertise from disciplines that develop and create graphic, product and spatial designs. This specialisation responds directly to the contemporary shift towards collaborative design engagement. It will operate both , conceptually and practically at the intersection of interior, graphic and industrial design practice. The program will expose you to design challenges that involve image, text, products, narratives, systems, services, public and private space, materiality and virtuality. These creative outputs are not approached as single entities, but in scenarios that require a comprehensive and holistic design approach. You will be required to demonstrate independent conceptual and practical skills and your ability to engage in collaborative design processes. The program will develop your professional awareness across the creative disciplines, prompt multidisciplinary design competencies, and promote broader skills in leadership, professional adaptability, and complex project planning. The final year of study provides the opportunity for you to pursue a major project, or extend your skills by participating in a leading industry project., ===Interaction design===, The interaction design , specialisation develops your skills and competencies in the design of contemporary artefacts, products and services that engage with interactive, user-focused technologies and processes. These can include, but are not limited to, health and medical equipment, 'smart' furniture, educational toys, wearable technologies, public information kiosks and transport systems. You can engage with a diverse range of interactive processes, including the application of advanced technologies, electronics and programming, physical and virtual interface manipulation, engineering and material fabrication and rapid prototyping. The specialisation equips you with an understanding of the unique relationship that exists between interactive activities, products and human behaviour. You will develop a critical awareness of current social and commercial issues pertaining to interaction and user experience design. The final year of study provides the opportunity for you to pursue a major project, or , extend your skills by participating in a leading industry-supported project., ===Multimedia design===, In the multimedia design specialisation you will engage with contemporary digital communication environments. This includes designing for the web, motion and animation, and interactive touch screen devices and surfaces. The specialisation emphasises an advanced knowledge of existing and emerging digital design processes and systems and embraces projects of varied scale, from hand-held smart devices to large public interactive screens. The studio units bring together practical design skills with the conceptual thinking required of contemporary digital communication environments. This includes an astute ability to construct a communication narrative, strategically and meaningfully engage multimedia processes with broader community and business needs, and understand the end-user's intuitive and iterative engagement with a project (web site, app and other screen-based media). , The final year of study provides the opportunity for you to pursue a major project, or extend your skills by participating in a leading industry project.",

Building on your qualification in medicine, dentistry, biomedical science or radiography, you will be able to apply your knowledge in the interests of justice and will learn to make high level, independent judgements in the forensic setting, gain sound knowledge of medico-legal principles, gain the skills to clearly communicate medico-legal issues to the justice system, prepare effective and objective medico-legal reports, critically evaluate the ethical and legal issues arising in forensic medical practice, and interpret wounds and injury patterns. You will have , developed a range of skills equipping you with the necessary attributes to work in the fields of forensic medicine, dentistry, or science within the parameters of the justice system., ==Specialisations ==, ===Clinical forensic medicine===, Clinical forensic medicine has evolved into an increasingly specialised area within the wider field of forensic medical practice. Clinical forensic medicine encompasses a wide range of activities at the interface of medical practice and the law. The range of medico-legal services overlap with many other medical specialty areas; paediatrics, gynaecology, clinical toxicology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, dentistry and forensic pathology. However, the discipline of clinical forensic medicine has become the home of the special issues inherent in child and adult sexual/physical assault, traffic medicine and custodial medicine. The above services are provided by clinicians working either exclusively in the field of clinical forensic medicine, , or in the other medical specialties including general practice. Increasingly, the courts (and other 'users' of clinical forensic expertise) scrutinise the knowledge and background of practitioners providing expert reports, and have a rising expectation of practitioners possessing formal qualifications in this field., ===Forensic medical science===, Forensic medical science encompasses a number of disciplines including forensic toxicology and pharmacology, mortuary technical science, forensic imaging, and forensic aspects of molecular biology., This field is focused on the recognition, identification and evaluation of physical evidence, the results of which will apply to a variety of case types, both for living and deceased individuals. In addition to the laboratory aspects of their work, forensic medical scientists require a sound understanding of forensic pathology and death investigation as the majority of work is conducted in a coronial environment., Forensic medical , science increasingly involves an understanding of advanced imaging modalities, such as CT, and an appreciation of the capabilities of fields such as forensic anthropology, molecular biology, and most especially clinical forensic medicine, forensic pathology and death investigation systems and protocols. The increasing demand for rigorously tested and analysed forensic evidence in the medico-legal environment means that practitioners now require higher level specialist tertiary qualifications., ===Forensic odontology===, Forensic odontology can be defined as the proper handling, examination and evaluation of dental evidence which will then be presented in the interest of justice. Forensic odontology is concerned with a wide range of activities at the interface of dental practice and the law such as human identification (including mass fatality victim identification), bite mark analysis, craniofacial trauma analysis, age estimation (of both the living and the deceased), child , abuse, and dental malpractice. Forensic odontology expertise is utilised across the medico-legal spectrum where practitioners work closely with forensic pathologists, clinical forensic medical practitioners, forensic anthropologists, and forensic scientists. Forensic odontology is an integral part of the medico-legal process and practitioners now require formal qualifications and ongoing training in order to satisfy the evidence-based needs of the courts and the justice system.",

Whichever your pathway to medicine at Monash, you will see the discoveries of our world-renowned researchers put into clinical practice and enjoy our links to the largest health-care provider network in Australia, which includes the Monash Medical Centre and The Alfred, Melbourne's major casualty hospital, Eastern Health and health services in rural, regional and outer metropolitan Melbourne. , The course is designed as an integrated curriculum, with units taught in an interdisciplinary fashion by staff from across the faculty and in a wide range of learning environments, both campus and , clinical., Students entering as graduates are given one year of credit, and the integrated medical and behavioural sciences of the first two years of the course are replaced by one year of accelerated study (Year A) at the Monash University School of Rural Health located on the Gippsland campus of Federation University Australia. Year A is largely campus-based, with rural clinical and community placements. The Churchill (Gippsland) facilities include a sophisticated clinical simulations centre and access to state of the art clinical training facilities at the Latrobe regional hospital, Warragul, Sale, Wonthaggi and Leongatha hospitals and GP learning centres across West, Central, South and East Gippsland. At the completion of this one year of study graduate-entry students join the school-leaver cohort in Year 3B. , Years 3B to 5D of the course are conducted in clinical settings, generally in hospitals and practices across metropolitan Melbourne and rural Victoria. During , this period students will spend around 40 hours per week working at a clinical site. This will provides students with time for self-directed study, and the time and opportunity to be in control of their own learning and to develop skills in problem-solving and the critical appraisal of information. Year 5D offers rotations through a number of clinical settings, such as aged care and emergency medicine, with the opportunity to undertake a scholarly intensive project., The graduate entry program is open only to applicants who have completed a Monash University degree in biomedical science (including those undertaking double degrees), pharmacy, physiotherapy and science (with the completion of specific units) or have completed or are in the final year of a bachelor's degree with a significant biomedical science content at an internationally recognised university. Information about admission requirements can be found online. , The course is accredited by the Australian Medical , Council. After successfully completing the course, graduates become eligible for provisional registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and the Medical Board of Australia. After serving a compulsory internship year of residence in an approved hospital, graduates become eligible for final registration in Victoria and other states of Australia. Graduates initially work as a doctor within the hospital system and can undertake further specialty training in a range of areas, such as general practice, obstetrics, paediatrics, psychiatry and surgery., To broaden your options, you will have the opportunity to take intermission from your medicine studies after Year 3B to undertake the honours year of the Bachelor of Medical Science (leading to the award of Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours)), and focus on an area of medical science research, before returning to the course. This will place you in an excellent position to continue with medical research at , a later stage, perhaps through a PhD, should you so wish. , ==Rural practice==, All students are encouraged to spend time in rural areas. In order for the University to meet the requirements of the Australian Government Rural Clinical Training and Support (RCTS) program, all students that hold a Commonwealth-supported place (CSP) are required to undertake a minimum of four weeks experience in rural areas. A cohort of students will be given the opportunity to spend up to two years in a rural site.",

A flexible course, it covers the multi-disciplinary chemical and biological science base used in researching and developing reliable, accessible and effective medicinal products., A pharmaceutical scientist is trained to select new targets for drug therapy that arise from basic research. As a pharmaceutical scientist you will have the scientific and technical knowledge to translate new targets into reliable, accessible and , effective treatments for patients., During the first 18 months you will develop your understanding of the foundations of pharmaceutical science and of the relationships between the different disciplines and their distinct roles in drug discovery and development. This will prepare you to choose your specialisation from one of the following fields:, + Drug discovery biology: the discovery and understanding of biological drug targets, and their modulation by chemicals and other substances, + Formulation science: the invention, manufacture and testing of new products such as pharmaceuticals, food and cosmetics, + Medicinal chemistry: the principles and techniques behind drug discovery and development., You will then develop specialist knowledge and techniques and your understanding of the application of pharmaceutical methods and of professional practices in the workplace and the laboratory.  The course encourages the development of strong research, communication, life-long , learning and team work skills and provides practical and theoretical training in planning, undertaking and documenting scientific research projects., You will study with one of the largest and most productive groups of pharmaceutical researchers in Australia, the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and you will graduate having worked in industry-standard facilities, such as to our Shimadzu high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) laboratory, and will be well prepared for postgraduate study or for employment in the global pharmaceutical industry., ==Specialisations==, ===Drug discovery biology ===, This field focuses on the biomedical science and pharmacology of drug discovery, with an understanding of biological drug targets, and their modulation by all types of active drug compounds. It explores the biotechnological aspects of drug design and evaluation, including discovering and evaluating new targets for testing drugs; the biological effects of drug candidates; , and translating outcomes into pharmaceutical products., ===Formulation science ===, This field involves formulating, designing and evaluating pharmaceuticals and other products and  explores the transformation of the active drug compounds into a finished product. This includes the  design, generation and evaluation of new pharmaceutical products and applications beyond, such as foods and personal products., ===Medicinal chemistry ===, This field is at the intersection of biology and chemistry and involves the study of how drugs work and how they are designed and made. Medicinal chemistry applies the principles and techniques of chemistry to discover and develop compounds that prevent, treat or cure disease. It's a feedback process of design, synthesis and biological testing to optimise the potency, selectivity and absorption in the body of a compound while minimising side effects.",
